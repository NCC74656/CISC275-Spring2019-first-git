1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

Done

2. What five objects are created in the main?

We are creating three Dogs
   -Fido, 4
   -Fido, 3
   -Alfie, 4

a Dog ArrayList, and a Comparator of type Animal

3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?

The constructor call is in Collections.sort(object, Comparator), and we are writing the class for our comparator immediately after the constructor call.
